But one of its most frustrating and misguided design decisions is its strict requirement to use spaces for indentation. This choice, particularly in an era where many programming languages and tools rely on tabs as the preferred method for indentation, stands out as an unnecessary complexity and a step backward in terms of developer ergonomics.\n\nIn this essay, I will argue that YAML‚Äôs insistence on using spaces instead of tabs is not just an inconvenience but a fundamental flaw in its design. While the intention may have been to prioritize clarity and simplicity, this decision leads to a host of problems, from errors caused by inconsistent indentation to unnecessary human errors and frustration. Ultimately, this choice makes YAML a less efficient and more error-prone tool for developers, especially when compared to formats that embrace tabs.\n\nThe Core Problem: Spaces Are Error-Prone and Inconsistent\nOne of the main arguments against YAML‚Äôs use of spaces is the simple fact that spaces are inherently error-prone. In YAML, indentation defines structure. A misplaced space can easily break the file, often resulting in cryptic error messages that are difficult to trace. Since YAML relies heavily on indentation to mark relationships between data elements (such as nested objects or lists), even the slightest misalignment can cause major parsing errors.\n\nConsider this simple YAML snippet:\n\nyaml\nCopy code\nname: John\naddress:\n    street: Main St\n    city: Springfield\nIf we mistakenly add or remove a space, say from the address line, we can easily introduce a parsing error. YAML parsers typically offer little more than an indistinct error message, which makes fixing such problems cumbersome. Contrast this with tabs, which are easier to spot. The issue here is that the mistake becomes glaringly obvious as soon as you inspect the indentation, whereas spaces can hide errors in plain sight until the file fails to parse.\n\nTabs, on the other hand, have clear visibility. The width of a tab is fixed, making it immediately apparent if two lines are misaligned. While some may argue that tabs introduce their own problems (such as inconsistent tab widths across editors), these issues are minimal compared to the chaos that ensues when dealing with spaces.\n\nThe Inconsistency of Spaces in Editors\nAnother significant issue with spaces is that they are often inconsistent across different text editors and IDEs. Some editors automatically convert tabs to spaces, others allow you to configure the number of spaces for indentation, and some use hardcoded defaults that you can‚Äôt change. This creates confusion for developers working on the same YAML file who may not realize they are using different indentation styles, leading to potential errors when the file is parsed.\n\nWith tabs, the situation is much clearer. One tab character is one tab. There is no ambiguity about how it will appear, regardless of the editor used. Tabs are also configurable in most modern IDEs, meaning that developers can specify how wide they want the tab character to appear. This offers flexibility without introducing the inconsistency found in spaces.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that tabs are independent of the font means there‚Äôs no need to worry about the font rendering differently across machines or editors. The experience is unified across the board, something spaces can‚Äôt guarantee, especially when working with contributors who use different setups.\n\nTabs Are More Efficient: Less Visual Clutter\nAnother overlooked benefit of tabs over spaces is their efficiency. Tabs are a single character, whereas spaces take up multiple characters to achieve the same effect. In YAML, this means that every indentation level adds multiple spaces to the document, which increases the file size without providing any additional value.\n\nFor instance, if your YAML document has deep nesting, the difference between using tabs and spaces becomes quite apparent. A file with 10 levels of indentation could potentially increase by hundreds of characters when using spaces. This may not seem like much, but for large files, this can result in unnecessary bloat, especially when the number of spaces required to represent indentation grows.\n\nTabs, by contrast, are more compact and efficient, as one tab can represent multiple indentation levels. This allows YAML documents to be more succinct and easier to manage, especially when dealing with complex, multi-level structures.\n\nTab-Only Formats: A More Consistent Approach\nOther languages and data formats that embrace tabs are far less prone to the issues that YAML faces. For example, JSON5 (an extension of JSON) allows for flexibility and simplicity without the mess of inconsistent indentation. Similarly, in programming languages like Python, Go, and Java, where indentation is critical for readability, the choice of using tabs for structure makes the code easier to maintain and debug.\n\nIn Python, for example, a tab represents an unambiguous, fixed indentation level, making the code highly consistent and easy to read. The same principles apply to Go, which enforces clear and consistent formatting, whether it's with blocks, functions, or variables. Tabs, in these languages, enforce a consistent style that avoids the pitfalls of YAML‚Äôs space-based structure.\n\nThe Ultimate Argument: Developer Productivity and Ergonomics\nUltimately, the biggest issue with YAML‚Äôs reliance on spaces is that it sacrifices developer productivity and ergonomics. Tabs are far more intuitive for a variety of reasons. For one, they offer a single keypress solution to indentation. By simply pressing the tab key, developers can quickly and consistently structure their data without worrying about the number of spaces or potential alignment issues.\n\nBy contrast, spaces require constant vigilance. Developers must ensure that every indentation level has the correct number of spaces, and that those spaces are consistent throughout the file. This becomes even more complicated when collaborating with others, as different team members might be using different editor settings or styles (e.g., two spaces vs. four spaces for indentation).\n\nAdditionally, the time spent troubleshooting spaces-based errors‚Äîwhether from accidental misalignment or mismatched editors‚Äîultimately detracts from developer productivity. The mental overhead of managing indentation is significant, especially for complex YAML files with multiple nested structures.\n\nConclusion: Why YAML‚Äôs Design Decision Is Fundamentally Flawed\nWhile YAML has many positive qualities, its use of spaces for indentation is a deeply flawed decision. The reliance on spaces introduces unnecessary complexity and human error, creates inconsistent behaviors across different tools, and reduces productivity due to the constant need to manage indentation. Tabs, in contrast, are more consistent, easier to work with, and far more efficient both in terms of file size and developer experience.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is not just a minor flaw. It‚Äôs a fundamental design issue that could have been easily avoided. If YAML had embraced tabs from the start, it would have sidestepped these problems, resulting in a more robust, developer-friendly, and maintainable format. The widespread adoption of spaces in YAML isn‚Äôt just a matter of preference‚Äîit‚Äôs an oversight that has made the lives of countless developers unnecessarily difficult. If the goal of YAML is to make data human-readable and easy to work with, then it‚Äôs high time to reconsider this core design choice and embrace tabs as the preferred method for indentation."", ""OK, boomer.

Solution was to open a new note and I was able to take handwritten notes with Scribble automatically converting to text. Will have to cut and paste to combine two notes. Although I generally liked having handwriting converted to text, I am not sure I like it in real time. For example, I couldn‚Äôt make a list because I couldn‚Äôt get scribble to use my line endings. So if the note is something other than linear text, real time Scribble gets in the way. So, I reluctantly agree with you to turn off Scribble or use an art app such as Procreate.

It was the last semester of my ‚ÄúMSc in Data Science and Big Data Analytics‚Äù, and I was supposed to start my internship, but I didn\'t get one. Around the first week of February, my batchmate (college friend) sent me the YouTube link to the ""Data Analyst - Roadmap"" video by Codebasics, and that was the first time I watched a roadmap video this detailed and informative, the video was around 30 mins long, till that time I hadn\'t seen any roadmap video this long.\n\r\nI started watching this, and I was amazed by how detailed and clearly Dhawal Sir explained everything. That was the very first time I understood the importance of LinkedIn. Till that time, I had only heard that LinkedIn is important, you should start networking, and all that, but nobody had explained it in detail as Dhawal Sir did.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I began my data analyst journey. As mentioned in the roadmap, I started with the ""Sales Insights"" project YouTube playlist. At that point, I hadn\'t figured out whether to go for a data scientist job role or a data analyst role, though I was in the final semester of my master\'s degree.\r\n\r\nHonestly, most students in my college were just passed on to the next semester, either by being given away marks or due to online exams, as the college wanted to showcase good results. That\'s why we never learned any subjects in detail.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the ""Sales Insights"" YouTube playlist, I went ahead and purchased the ""Power BI"" course, it was initially 17 17hrs which is now upgraded to 20 hrs. The quality and level of content you have provided are simply outstanding, beyond words. I remember the ""Finance View"" chapter had all the DAX measures in it. It took me a while to complete and grasp all those things. One small mistake while creating measures, and the values would be mismatched, and it used to take 30-40 minutes to spot that mistake. Once the \'Finance View\' was done, the other chapters became easier.\r\n\r\nThe project was so detailed, exactly like it is conducted in the industry. It was amazing to learn from it, especially the stakeholder discussion chapter. I have made specific notes on it. I have learned every single thing from the Codebasics platform and the short videos where you share useful tips.\r\n\r\nThe posts that Hemanand Sir shares daily on LinkedIn are so detailed, explaining everything about the data analyst career, the current situation, things regarding interviews, and so on. My whole LinkedIn profile is built because of your learnings and impact. I started sending connection requests first to people who have completed ""Codebasics"" courses and those who have participated in your resume project challenges. I started going through their profiles, and I learned everything from there. No one on YouTube, LinkedIn, or the internet is doing as much for students as you are.\r\n\r\nThe reason I\'m sharing all this is not to get the hoodies or freebies but solely to tell you how much your videos have contributed to my life and how big learning your LinkedIn posts have been. Please keep up the good work; it is helping many who need real guidance.\n\r\nBecause of your content, we got introduced to profiles like Muskan Handa, NAVEEN S, and Shashank Singh. Thanks to your platform.\n\r\nI am still an aspirant looking for a job, but your videos and content have made me confident and ready for the industry. I do share the knowledge I have gained from your channel, courses, and videos with people around me and on LinkedIn. Without any promotions or marketing, you\'ve created pure content with genuine value that\'s spreading entirely through word of mouth. I look forward to doing something similar to what you do in my data career. \n\r\nThank you entire Codebasics team. @Dhaval Patel @Hemanand Vadivel\r\n\r\n#Codebasics #GratitudeWaliDiwali', '#GratitudeWaliDiwali #CodeBasics \nHappy Diwali Codebasics team, Dhaval Sir and Hemanand sir.\nWhen I was considering changing my career, I did research on both technical and non-technical fields. I started with some free courses, but soon I realized that I needed proper guidance to make the right choice. However, I didn\'t want to get stuck with the wrong faculty, so I looked for options that offered a demo class before enrolling. That\'s when I discovered CodeBasics on YouTube and followed them on LinkedIn. I found out about their bootcamp, which offers a 30 day refund policy. This meant I could get a 30 day ""demo"" period, and the best part was that if I decided it wasn\'t for me they would refund the money with no questions asked. For an introvert like me, it was the perfect setup. I enrolled, and the way Dhaval sir and Hemanand sir teach is like learning from friends, with the ""Avengers"" theme things become even more fascinating. I am grateful to CodeBasics, Tony Sharma and Peter Pandey for their invaluable help and support.\nIt was because of them that I had the courage to systematically change my career. Otherwise I could have enrolled in some random 9Rs course.üòÇ\nWhen I was hesitant to post my first project, I came across a post by Hemanand Sir, where he encouraged us not to compare ourselves with experienced professionals. I still follow that advice and try to improve myself day by day.\nUltimately, I want to help others find confidence and clarity in their career journey, as my mentor did for me.']"

290,h4lMki73g0w,"[""Summary of key insights from this session\n\n[1] Data analytics is not just about building dashboard in 15 minutes or 1 hour. It is a minor part of data analyst work.\n\n[2] It is not that easy for freshers or anyone to get a DA job as it is glorified on the internet. As of Aug 2024 there is a huge competition and limited roles. A fresher should do something outstanding to get recruiters attention- like having a solid project portfolio, online credibility on LinkedIn, cold emailing, messaging on LinkedIn to get recommendations etc.\n\n[3] Do not buy any paid course directly if you have no idea about this field. Spend 3-4 days on solid research. Learn from free resources first to understand if you like this role, do more research about market condition. Most importantly do not blindly believe anyone on the internet - do your own research.\n\n[4] Offline networking can be a game changer for both freshers, people with career break and experienced people from wanting to transition career. Check for the offline events near your place and join them.\n\n[5] 100 % Job guarantee, pay after placement, get 24 LPA - all these are scams running in the market. If you do not pay time extra for research you will loose both your money and time.\n\n[6] Domain knowledge is key. Freshers can domain knowledge by starting with business KPIs, understanding the business process behind the apps use, checking customer stories on Microsoft, following case studies, solving unguided projects (check codebasics resume project challenges - https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge). This won't completely replace the need for practical experience but it will be better than having no experience.\n\n[7] People with career gap or transitioning career should try to combine their past domain experience with their tool skills to make a strong resume and apply for roles particular to that domain. For example, a person with sales experience in telecom domain should have projects particular to that domain/function to show relevant experience and also maintain the salary range.\n\nThere are more insights in this video, watch it fully if you are interested."", ""This was such an invaluable roundtable discussion! I took extensive notes and wanted to share some key insights that might help others:\n\r\n- Reality check: 80% of DA work isn't dashboards - it's data hunting, cleaning, and stakeholder management\r\n- Success formula: Pick a niche, build domain expertise (even 10-15% helps!), and create industry-relevant projects\r\n- Project tip: Don't just use one tool - combine SQL, Excel, and Power BI to mirror real industry workflows\r\n- Career growth: Focus on storytelling skills and simple communication - they're checking this specifically in interviews\r\n- Standing out: Don't just follow the crowd (certificates alone won't cut it) - be creative in your approach\r\n- Job hunting: Cold email outreach works but be specific (include job IDs!) and keep your ATS score >80%\n\r\nThank you @Codebasics ‚ù§  for bringing together these industry experts and creating such an educational platformü§ù.

John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16\r\n\r\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 \r\n\r\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8\r\n\r\nI am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9\r\n\r\nThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.\r\n- Romans 10:9-11 KJV\r\n\r\nFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\r\n- Romans 10:13 KJV\r\n\r\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

John 3:17\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\r\n- John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12\r\n\r\nFor if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 \r\n\r\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 \r\n\r\nAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\r\n- Mark 1:15 KJV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\r\n- John 3:36 KJV\r\n\r\nWho hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 \r\n\r\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 \r\n\r\nThe Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9\r\n\r\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16\r\n\r\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 \r\n\r\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]"

Only they have been taught what is what and that too the technologies they study in college syllabus is pretty much outdated. And they are lacking skills where to use and how to apply those technologies what they learnt in real world use cases.\n\nSo here comes my suggestion to discord community and code basics on it. Let us find and come with a most important and interesting use case of this world and come with solutions of it through various technologies.\n\nSay suppose the use case is to address climate change problem and take it to people of different parts of the world on this,  skillsbasics use case is this. So web and app development team of skillsbasics complete course is to make an end to end app on this use case. Machine learning course of skillsbasics solve the same use case though their algorithms to make predictions on the same. So on whole what i mean is let us take an idea as a use case and implies various technologies on the same and give the real world use case as a package to the learner of the course. From learner's perspective, more than learning a technology, it will be like reading a story book, which will also walk him through the technologies as well encouraging him to think about helping the people of the world by addressing real world common problems of them.\n\nAnd I strongly possess learning technologies will do nothing unless we apply it to solve the problem of common people through it.

This means that any changes made to square_result inside the calc_square function are not reflected in the main process‚Äôs memory space.\r\n\r\nTo share data between processes, you can use shared memory objects provided by the multiprocessing module, such as multiprocessing.Manager().list()\n\nNote: the question above seems to be answered in the next video (#28), I have not watched the whole video yet, but the introduction of the next video seem to raise the issue above...', 'hey there!! your all videos are very amazing and easily understandable ..however in this video i m getting error over the line p1=multiprocessing.Process(target=calc_square, args=(arr,))\ni even copied your given source code bt still its showing attribute error .. can you please help me out !!', 'thanks', 'I like that background music it helps in staying concentrated more.', 'This might be a dumb question but will multithreading and multiprocessing work in jupyter?', ""I still don't understand why when you print the global list it does not showed anything.

I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform.

Some sort of service or ""fishbowl"" style masterclass could also accomplish this.  \n\nThe ""community answers"" feature in StrataScratch is new and very helpful as there is more than one solution to these issues.

I think for a follow up video, it would be interesting to take this further and apply to diverse types of analysis used today in different areas. \n\nUser analysis, product analysis, financial analysis (dealing with profit/revenue), marketing analysis (related to campaigns etc.), fraud analysis, stock market analysis, are all different \'worlds\' I had to work in as a data analyst, with varying degrees of involvement, and being involved in different stages of the data analysis phase. \n\nExample for user analysis/behaviour: - User Behaviour with a website/product: \nStep 1 could be like ""Why do 30% of our subscribers drop at the end of the year"". The question can come from leadership, or it is something you will notice before anyone else and will have to tackle it. \nStep 2 could be ""Success would be Subscriber who is retained after the end of year"" \nStep 3: What trends should we measure for this? We should be looking at logins (active logins) of subscribers who drop, and subscribers who are retained. Or we can look at what premium features are being used by retained subscribers, and what is the engagement like for subscribers who drop? Do any of the dropped subscribers run into any technical issues? Do any of them contact customer support for any assistance with these features? \nStep 4: Events needs are login event, active flag or condition (customer signed in at least once in the past 30 days), what areas of the website/product they interacted with, so actual URLs or component names \nStep 5: The audience in this case product manager, senior leadership, etc. \n\nJust trying to think of how this amazing guide can be applied to real-world scenarios out in the field. I completely agree with you that one must sometimes force clients to be a part of this, but other times, we are ""stuck"" on our own to come up with baselines/hypothesis with no guidance or existing KPIs in place.
